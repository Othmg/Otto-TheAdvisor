# Otto-TheAdvisor
Portfolio Robo-advisor
This is a simple robo-advisor. It asks for your personal information to create a profile of your ability and willigness to take financial risks in your investments.
It then uses this information to suggest a balanced portfolio (Stock-bonds) and several ETFs with the appropriate risk-return profile.
